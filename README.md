# Fleet Management Dashboard 

The dashboard provides an overview of key metrics related to drivers, including the total number of drivers, total fuel consumption, total distance traveled, fixed costs, total fuel used, and maintenance costs. It also shows a trend of kilometers traveled over the past two years. Additionally, a summary table details the kilometers, fuel usage, average fuel consumption, fixed costs, and maintenance costs for each driver, offering a clear view of individual performance and operational efficiency.
